# Client-Server Implementation

This is a C++ client-server application using TCP sockets, built to learn and experiment with networking concepts.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Establishes TCP connections between client and server
- Uses custom message headers and data structures
- Demonstrates synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
- Uses a thread-safe queue to handle incoming/outgoing messages

## 🔄 Currently working on:
- Improve message handling
- Add proper logging
- Handle disconnects
- Add multiclient support
## Testing

### Test 1: Client-Server Connection

📄 [View Test Details and Screenshot](docs/test1_notes.md)

The first test verifies that a client can successfully establish a connection with the server. This was done using [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) to simulate a client. When a connection is established, the server prints the client's IP address, confirming a successful handshake.

🧪 **Result:** Connection established successfully and logged on the server side.
